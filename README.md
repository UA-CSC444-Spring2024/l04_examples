These examples cover some of the basics of HTML, CSS, SVG:

* index.html -- a basic boilerplate HTML file that includes l04.js and begins with 3 divs
* map.js -- map() example from class
* chaining.js -- object chaining example
* l04.js -- basic DOM examples.  When loading index.html in the browser, you will see the result of these (in class, we did them as interactive in the console)
